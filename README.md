# Clinic API

A Spring Boot REST API for managing doctors, patients, and appointments — built as a **learning target for Prometheus, Grafana, and Kubernetes observability training**.

The app ships with a Python load simulator that drives realistic traffic so Prometheus metrics come alive and Grafana dashboards animate during workshops.

**Everything runs in Docker.**

---

## Requirements

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Maven 3.8+ (only to build the jar once before the Docker image is built)

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Build the jar
mvn clean package -DskipTests

# 2. Start MySQL + Clinic API + Prometheus
docker-compose up --build

# 3. In a separate terminal — build and run the load simulator
cd clinic-load-simulator
docker build -t clinic-load-simulator .
docker run --network host clinic-load-simulator
```

Open `http://localhost:9090` in Prometheus and watch the metrics populate.

---

## Services

| Container | Port | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `clinic-mysql` | 3306 | MySQL 8.0 database |
| `clinic-api` | 9999 | Spring Boot REST API |
| `prometheus` | 9090 | Prometheus metrics server |

`clinic-api` waits for `clinic-mysql` to pass its healthcheck before starting. Prometheus starts after `clinic-api`.

---

## Demo Data

On first startup, the app automatically seeds the database (dev profile):

- 4 doctors — Cardiology, Pediatrics, Orthopedics, Neurology (one set as unavailable for testing)
- 3 patients
- 4 appointments in SCHEDULED / CONFIRMED status

## Sample Request Bodies

**Create Doctor:**
```json
{
  "name": "Dr. Jane Smith",
  "gender": "Female",

  "email": "jane.smith@clinic.com",
  "password": "Pass@1234"
}
```

**Update appointment status:**
```
PATCH /api/appointments/1/status?status=CONFIRMED
```

## Observability

### Prometheus Metrics Endpoint

```
http://localhost:9999/actuator/prometheus
```

### Custom Business Counters

These are event-driven — services publish Spring `ApplicationEvent`s and `ClinicMetricsListener` records the counters. Business code has no Micrometer imports.

| Metric | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `clinic_appointments_created_total` | Counter | Total appointments booked |
| `clinic_appointments_cancelled_total` | Counter | Total appointments cancelled |
| `clinic_doctors_created_total` | Counter | Total doctors registered |
| `clinic_doctors_deleted_total` | Counter | Total doctors deleted |
| `clinic_patients_created_total` | Counter | Total patients registered |

### Live-State Gauges

Registered in `ClinicGaugesRegistrar` — the DB is queried on every Prometheus scrape.

| Metric | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `clinic_appointments_scheduled_total` | Gauge | Current appointments in SCHEDULED state |
| `clinic_appointments_today_total` | Gauge | Appointments booked for today |

### Service Latency Histograms

Every service method is annotated with `@Timed`. The AOP aspect records execution time automatically — no manual instrumentation.

| Metric prefix | Example |
|---|---|
| `clinic_service_appointments_create_seconds_*` | Latency for booking an appointment |
| `clinic_service_doctors_create_seconds_*` | Latency for registering a doctor |
| `http_server_requests_seconds_*` | Auto-instrumented HTTP layer (free from Actuator) |

### Actuator Endpoints

```
http://localhost:9999/actuator/health
http://localhost:9999/actuator/metrics
http://localhost:9999/actuator/prometheus
http://localhost:9999/actuator/env
http://localhost:9999/actuator/loggers
http://localhost:9999/actuator/beans
```

## Load Simulator

Located in `clinic-load-simulator/`. Runs 6 concurrent traffic scenarios against the API.

```bash
cd clinic-load-simulator
docker build -t clinic-load-simulator .

# Default run
docker run --network host clinic-load-simulator

# More workers
docker run --network host clinic-load-simulator \
  python clinic_load_simulator.py --workers 10

# Specific scenarios
docker run --network host clinic-load-simulator \
  python clinic_load_simulator.py --scenarios happy_path,cancel_flood

# Limited iterations (useful for demos)
docker run --network host clinic-load-simulator \
  python clinic_load_simulator.py --iterations 50
```

**Available scenarios:**

| Scenario | What it generates |
|---|---|
| `happy_path` | Full lifecycle: create doctor + patient, book, confirm, complete |
| `slot_conflict` | Double-booking same slot → 409 errors |
| `bad_doctor` | Booking with non-existent doctorId → 404 errors |
| `bad_validation` | Malformed payloads → 400 errors |
| `read_traffic` | GET flood across all list/search/filter endpoints |
| `cancel_flood` | Create then immediately cancel → drives cancellation counter |

## Stopping Everything

```bash
# Stop the compose stack
docker-compose down

# Stop and wipe the database (clean slate)
docker-compose down -v
```
