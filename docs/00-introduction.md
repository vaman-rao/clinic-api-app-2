## Introduction

Welcome to the Cloud-Native Monitoring and Alerting Bootcamp. Over five intensive days, you will learn to observe, instrument, alert on, and visualize a real-world Spring Boot microservice — the **Clinic Management API** — running inside a Kubernetes cluster.

This documentation is your complete reference for all five days. Every concept explained here is directly tied to code you will run, not hypothetical examples.

## The Clinic API — Your Training Application

Throughout this bootcamp we use a deliberately realistic Spring Boot REST API that manages a clinic. It has three core entities and production-grade concerns already built in:

| Entity / Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Doctor` | Registered medical practitioners with specialization, availability flag, and contact details |
| `Patient` | Registered patients with date of birth, blood group, and contact details |
| `Appointment` | Links a Doctor and Patient to a date/time slot; has status lifecycle (`SCHEDULED → CONFIRMED → COMPLETED`) |
| `GlobalExceptionHandler` | Catches all exceptions and returns structured JSON error responses with HTTP status codes |
| `Micrometer Metrics` | Business metrics via event-driven counters (`ClinicMetricsListener`) and DB-backed gauges (`ClinicGaugesRegistrar`); service latency via `@Timed` AOP |
| `Spring Boot Actuator` | Exposes `/actuator/prometheus`, `/actuator/health`, `/actuator/metrics` endpoints |

---

## Why This Application?

Real observability challenges appear when:

- Entities have **relationships** — an appointment cannot exist without a valid Doctor and Patient
- **Business rules** are enforced — a doctor's slot cannot be double-booked
- **Errors are structured** — invalid requests return JSON with field-level validation details
- **Metrics are meaningful** — counters track appointments created, gauges show live scheduled count

## Prerequisites Checklist

Before Day 1 begins, confirm all of the following work on your laptop. Run each command and verify no errors.

> ⚠️ **Important:** If anything fails, contact the trainer immediately — lab time cannot be used for environment setup.

```bash
# 1. Docker
docker run hello-world

# 2. Kubernetes (Minikube or Kind)
minikube start          # OR: kind create cluster
kubectl get nodes

# 3. Helm
helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable
helm version

# 4. Java 17
java -version           # should show 17.x

# 5. Deploy a test pod
kubectl run nginx-test --image=nginx
kubectl get pod nginx-test
```

### Minimum Hardware

| Requirement | Minimum |
|---|---|
| Architecture | 64-bit (Intel i5 or equivalent) |
| RAM | 16 GB |
| Free Disk | 100 GB |
| OS | Windows 11 / macOS |
| Internet | ≥ 50 Mbps |

### Required Software

| Tool | Notes |
|---|---|
| Docker | Latest stable |
| Minikube or Kind | Either one |
| `kubectl` CLI | Matches your cluster version |
| Helm v3+ | |
| Git | |
| Java 17+ | |
